Selection lets you select fields that you want to fetch from the query on a particular type.

SwiftGraphQL generates phantom types for your operations, objects, interfaces and unions. You can use these in combination with `Selection` type to generate a concrete type for your selection (e.g. `Selection<String, Objects.Human>`). You can find all generated phantom types by typing

- `Unions.`
- `Interfaces.`
- `Objects.`
- `Operations.`

followed by a name from your GraphQL schema.

Most of the time, however, you should use `Selection.` that contains type-alias for unions, interfaces, objects and operations. In that case, you don't have to specify the type-lock anymore and simply provide the return type (e.g. `Selection.Human<String>`).

### Selecting Fields

##### `Unions`

When fetching a union you should provide selections for each of the union sub-types. Additionally, all of those selections should resolve to the same type.

```swift
let union = Selection.CharacterUnion<String> {
    try $0.on(
        human: Selection.Human<String> { try $0.funFact() },
        droid: Selection.Droid<String> { try $0.primaryFunction() }
    )
}
```

You'd usually want to create a Swift enumerator and have different selecitons return different cases.

##### `Interfaces`

Interfaces are very similar to unions. The only difference is that you may query for a common field from the intersection.

```swift
let interface = Selection.Character<String> {

    /* Common */
    let name = try $0.name()

    /* Fragments */
    let about = try $0.on(
        droid: Selection.Droid<String> { try $0.primaryFunction() },
        human: Selection.Human<String> { try $0.homePlanet() }
    )

    return "\(name). \(about)"
}
```

### Transforming Selections

##### Nullable, List, and Non-Nullable Selection

Selection packs a collection of utility functions that let you select nullable and list fields using your existing selecitons.
Each selection comes with three calculated properties that let you do that:

- `list` - to query lists
- `nullable` - to query nullable fields
- `nonNullOrFail` - to query nullable fields that should be there

```swift
// Create a non-nullable selection.
let human = Selection.Human<Human> {
    Human(
        id: try $0.id(),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}

// Use it with nullable and list fields.
let query = Selection.Query<Void> {
    let list = try $0.humans(human.list)
    let nullable = try $0.human(id: "100", human.nullable)
}
```

You can achieve the same effect using `Selection` static functions `.list`, `.nullable`, and `.nonNullOrFail`.

```swift
// Use it with nullable and list fields.
let query = Selection.Query<[Human]> {
    try $0.humans(Selection.list(human))
}
```

##### Making selection on the entire type

You might want to write a selection on the entire type from the selection composer itself. This usually happens if you have a distinct identifier reused in many types.

Consider the following scenario where we have an `id` field in `Human` type. There are many cases where we only query `id` field from the `Human` that's why we create a human id selection.

```swift
let humanId = Selection<HumanID, Objects.Human> {
    HumanID.fromString(try $0.id())
}
```

Now, we want to reuse that same selection when query a detailed human type. To do that, we can use `selection` helper method that lets you make a selection on the whole `TypeLock` from inside the selection.

```swift
struct Human {
    let id: HumanID
    let name: String
}

let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: try $0.selection(humanId),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}
```

An alternative approach would be to manually rewrite the selection inside `Human` again.

```swift
let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: HumanID.fromString(try $0.id()),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}
```

Having distinct types for ids of different object types is particularly useful in large projects as it gives you verification that you are not using a wrong identifier for a particular type of field. At first, this might seem useless and cumbersome, but it makes your code more robust once you get used to it.

##### Mapping Selection

You might want to map the result of your selection to a new type and get a selection for that new type.
You can do that by calling a `map` function on selection and provide a mapping.

```swift
struct Human {
    let id: String
    let name: String
}

// Create a selection.
let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: try $0.id(),
        name: try $0.name(),
    )
}

// Map the original selection on Human to return String.
let humanName: Selection<String, Objects.Human> = human.map { $0.name }
```

> ⚠️ Don't make any nested calls to the API. Use the first half of the initializer to fetch all the data and return the calculated result. Just don't make nested requests.

```swift
// WRONG!
let human = Selection.Human { select in
    let message: String
    if try select.likesStrawberries() {
        message = try select.name()
    } else {
        message = try select.homePlanet()
    }
    return message
}

// Correct.
let human = Selection.Human { select in

    /* Data */
    let likesStrawberries = try select.likesStrawberries()
    let name = try select.name()
    let homePlanet = try select.homePlanet()

    /* Return */
    let message: String
    if likesStrawberries {
        message = name
    } else {
        message = homePlanet
    }
    return message
}
```

### Validating Data

Since SwiftGraphQL uses functions to create selections, you may validate recieved data before turning it into a Swift structure. This way, you can use more structure to represent your data and make stricter requirements than those imposed by schema.

You can easily terminate resolution by throwing an error inside your selection.

> NOTE: Always make all selection before throwing errors!

```swift
// Model
enum Animal {
    // Cat with a name and age.
    case cat(String, Int)
    // Dog with a name and isGoodDog flag.
    case dog(String, Bool)
}

// Selection
let animal = Selection.DogOrCat<Animal> {
    let name = try $0.name()
    let age: Int? = try $0.age()
    let isGoodDog: Bool? = try $0.isGoodDog()

    if let age = age {
        return .cat(name, age)
    }

    if let isGoodDog = isGoodDog {
        return .dog(name, isGoodDog)
    }

    throw "Animal should be either cat or dog!"
}

extension String: Error {}
```

> NOTE: `age` and `isGoodDog` values are nullable in our schema but aren't nullable in our model.

### Operations on selection

Selections are quite useless on their own - they feel a bit like skeletons. Their true (and only) power comes from the two functions they expose - `query` and `decode`.

- `query` returns a spec-compliant GraphQL query and a variable set that you should use in your request.
- `decode` accepts the body of the response and returns the decoded result.

> `query` and `decode` don't actually communicate with the server. To do that, use one of the official clients or create your own.

> Besides `query` and `decode` selection also contains wide range of utility functions that help you understand the structure of a given query. Those functions won't be covered here. You should follow their comments to understand what they do and examine official clients to see how they are used.
