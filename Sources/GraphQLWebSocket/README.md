#  GraphQLWebSocket

> GraphQLWebSocket package implements the `graphql-ws` specification. 

It may be used independently of other parts of SwiftGraphQL and doesn't lock you in to the system even though it works nicely with it.

Note that GraphQLWebSocket is not compatible with `subscriptions-transport-ws`.
