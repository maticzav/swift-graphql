Selection lets you select fields that you want to fetch from the query on a particular type.

SwiftGraphQL has generated phantom types for your operations, objects, interfaces and unions. You can find them by typing `Unions.`/`Interfaces.`/`Objects.`/`Operations.` followed by a name from your GraphQL schema. You plug those into the `Scope` parameter.

The other parameter `Type` is what your constructor should return.

> We generate type alias in selection which let you use XCode intellisnse and may infer your return type. They work like `Selection.ObjectName`.

##### Nullable, list, and non-nullable fields

Selection packs a collection of utility functions that let you select nullable and list fields using your existing selecitons.
Each selection comes with three calculated properties that let you do that:

- `list` - to query lists
- `nullable` - to query nullable fields
- `nonNullOrFail` - to query nullable fields that should be there

```swift
// Create a non-nullable selection.
let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: try $0.id(),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}

// Use it with nullable and list fields.
let query = Selection.Query {
    let list = try $0.humans(human.list)
    let nullable = try $0.human(id: "100", human.nullable)
}
```

You can achieve the same effect using `Selection` static functions `.list`, `.nullable`, and `.nonNullOrFail`.

```swift
// Use it with nullable and list fields.
let query = Selection.Query {
    let list = try $0.humans(Selection.list(human))
}
```

##### Making selection on the entire type

You might want to write a selection on the entire type from the selection composer itself. This usually happens if you have a distinct identifier reused in many types.

Consider the following scenario where we have an `id` field in `Human` type. There are many cases where we only query `id` field from the `Human` that's why we create a human id selection.

```swift
let humanId = Selection<HumanID, Objects.Human> {
    HumanID.fromString(try $0.id())
}
```

Now, we want to reuse that same selection when query a detailed human type. To do that, we can use `selection` helper method that lets you make a selection on the whole `TypeLock` from inside the selection.

```swift
struct Human {
    let id: HumanID
    let name: String
}

let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: try $0.selection(humanId),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}
```

An alternative approach would be to manually rewrite the selection inside `Human` again.

```swift
let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: HumanID.fromString(try $0.id()),
        name: try $0.name()
    )
}
```

Having distinct types for ids of different object types is particularly useful in large projects as it gives you verification that you are not using a wrong identifier for a particular type of field. At first, this might seem useless and cumbersome, but it makes your code more robust once you get used to it.

##### Mapping Selection

You might want to map the result of your selection to a new type and get a selection for that new type.
You can do that by calling a `map` function on selection and provide a mapping.

```swift
struct Human {
    let id: String
    let name: String
}

// Create a selection.
let human = Selection.Human {
    Human(
        id: try $0.id(),
        name: try $0.name(),
    )
}

// Map the original selection on Human to return String.
let humanName: Selection<String, Objects.Human> = human.map { $0.name }
```

> ⚠️ Don't make any nested calls to the API. Use the first half of the initializer to fetch all the data and return the calculated result. Just don't make nested requests.

```swift
// WRONG!
let human = Selection.Human { select in
    let message: String
    if try select.likesStrawberries() {
        message = try select.name()
    } else {
        message = try select.homePlanet()
    }
    return message
}

// Correct.
let human = Selection.Human { select in

    /* Data */
    let likesStrawberries = try select.likesStrawberries()
    let name = try select.name()
    let homePlanet = try select.homePlanet()

    /* Return */
    let message: String
    if likesStrawberries {
        message = name
    } else {
        message = homePlanet
    }
    return message
}
```

### `Unions`

When fetching a union you should provide selections for each of the union sub-types. Additionally, all of those selections should resolve to the same type.

```swift
let characterUnion = Selection.CharacterUnion {
    try $0.on(
        human: .init { try $0.funFact() /* String */ },
        droid: .init { try $0.primaryFunction() /* String */ }
    )
}
```

You'd usually want to create a Swift enumerator and have different selecitons return different cases.

### `Interfaces`

Interfaces are very similar to unions. The only difference is that you may query for a common field from the intersection.

```swift
let characterInteface = Selection.Character {

    /* Common */
    let name = try $0.name()

    /* Fragments */
    let about = try $0.on(
        droid: Selection<String, Objects.Droid> { droid in try droid.primaryFunction() /* String */ },
        human: Selection<String, Objects.Human> { human in try human.homePlanet() /* String */ }
    )

    return "\(name). \(about)"
}
```

You'd usually want to create a Swift enumerator and have different selecitons return different cases.

### `OptionalArgument`

- `SwiftGraphQL`

GraphQL's `null` value in an input type may be entirely omitted to represent the absence of a value or supplied as `null` to provide `null` value. This comes in especially handy in mutations.

Because of that, every input object that has an optional property accepts an optional argument that may either be `.present(value)`, `.absent()` or `.null()`. We use functions to support recursive type annotations that GraphQL allows.

> NOTE: Every nullable argument is by default absent so you don't have to write boilerplate.
