## Overview

SwiftGraphQL is a GraphQL Client that ships with a type-safe query builder. It lets you perform queries, mutations and listen for subscriptions. The query builder guarantees that every query you _can_ create is valid and complies with the GraphQL spec.

The library is centered around three core principles:

- ðŸš€ If your project compiles, your queries work.
- ðŸ¦‰ Use Swift in favour of GraphQL wherever possible.
- ðŸŒ³ Your application model should be independent of your schema.

Here's how you can create a query:

```swift
import SwiftGraphQL

enum Planet: String {
    case earth
}

// Define a Swift model.
struct Human: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let planet: Planet?
}

// Create a selection.
let human = Selection.Human<Human> {
    let id: String = try $0.id()
    let name: String = try $0.name()

    // Represent the planet using different Swift type.
    let rawPlanet: String? = try $0.planet()
    guard let homePlanet = Planet(rawValue: rawPlanet) else {
        throw "Invalid planet"
    }

    return Human(id: id, name: name, homePlanet: homePlanet)
}
```
