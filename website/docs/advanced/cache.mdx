This document outlines how the official SwiftGraphQL client does caching.

> SwiftGraphQL's caching mechanisms are heavily inspired by [Urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql).

# Overview

SwiftGraphQL's cache works like cache in the browser - once you've queried something, you can reuse that result instead of sending a network request again. Naturally, we ask ourselves

1. How we identify the same queries?
1. How do we make sure data doesn't become outdated?

## Operation Keys

Each SwiftGraphQL query contains a deterministic key that's constructed from the selection and variables.

Once a result comes in, it's indefinitely cached using this key. Therefore, if you send the same query again, we check the in-memory cache for possible existing results and use them instead.

In some cases greedily reusing the cache isn't the best solution. That's why SwiftGraphQL lets you chose from four different querying options:

- `cacheFirst` (default) - _prefers cached results and falls back to sending a network request when there's no existing cache_
- `cacheAndNetwork` - _returns cached results immediately but also sends an API request and updates the data on response_
- `networkOnly` - _always sensds a network request and ignores cache entirely_
- `cacheOnly` - _always returns cached result or `nil`_

> Regardless of your query caching option SwiftGraphQL caches your result if some other part of your code may want to reuse it.

## Cache Invalidation

As you update the data in one part of the app, results might become outdated in another part. SwiftGraphQL gives you the flexibility of choosing how that cache becomes invalidated.

You can choose between

- Document Caching - _greedy with less automation_
- Normalized Caching - _clever and complex_

Read on to learn more about each.

# Document Caching

Document caching is a default, simple caching mechanism that greedily requests new data when performing mutations. By checking the return type of your mutation it reexecutes and invalidates all cached values that contain that type.

For example, if you have a running query that streams feed of `[Post]` then a mutation `createPost` that returns a new `Post` triggers re-execution of that feed query automatically.

If your queries are deep and depend on many types, they are more likely to be automatically revalidated.

# Normalized Caching
