title: Creating GraphQL Selection
sidebar_label: Query Builder
---

SwiftGraphQL lets you query data, perform mutations and even listen for subscriptions. Let's start with the a simple query!

```swift
let hello = Selection.Query<String> { builder in
    try builder.world()
}
```

1. First, we create a `Selection.Query` since we are going to select a field in the root `Query`. This is a generic type that can be used to query any type of data. In this case, we're querying a `String` value, that's why we particularize the generic to return a string.
1. Second, we create a closure that will be called to create a selection and to decode returned value. That closure will receive a `QueryBuilder` as an argument that lets us select `world` field in the `Query`.
1. Lastly, we assign the selection to a value so we can reuse it in many places.

## Sending Requests

Once we have created a selection for our types, we may use one of the networking methods to send a request to the server. You may use one of the official networking libraries to send the request. Let's use a basic library that ships with `send` and `listen` methods.

## Examples

```swift
let query = Selection.Query<[Human]> {
    try $0.humans(Human.selection.list)
}

send(query, to: "http://localhost:4000") { result in
    if let data = try? result.get() {
        print(data)
    }
}
```

```swift
let subscription = Subscriptions.onHuman<Human>(Human.selection)

// Start the event.
let task = listen(for: subscription, on: "ws://localhost:4000/graphql") { result in
    if let data = try? result.get() {
        print(data)
    }
}

// To close the socket.
task.close()
```

Read more about selection and modifiers in [selection documentation](/advanced/selection).

> ❗️ NOTE: You should handle the closing of sockets. SwiftGraphQL intentionally doesn't handle websocket state and only implements the decoding and sending mechanism.

GraphQL differentiates between different kinds of absent variables when dealing with inputs. A variable may be

- present (e.g. "21 years old")
- null (e.g. "we don't know how old a person is")
- missing (e.g. "we shouldn't change the current value").

To present all cases, SwiftGraphQL uses `OptionalArgument` enumerator.

```swift
enum OptionalArgument<Value> {
	case present(Value?)
	case absent
}
```

> NOTE: Every nullable argument is by default absent so you don't have to write boilerplate code.

Because writing `OptionalArgument` is cumbersome, SwiftGraphQL provides a convenience operator `~` that transforms scalar values into present optional arguments.

```swift
let variable: OptionalArgument<Int> = ~21

let query = Selection.Query<String?> {
	let user = $0.user(id: ~"uid-17032000", selection: User.selection)
	return user.name
}

let mutation = Selection.Mutation<Void> {
	try $0.createUser(name: ~"John Doe", age: ~nil)
}
```
