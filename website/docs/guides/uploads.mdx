You might be tempted to slam `scalar Upload` on top of your GraphQL Schema and process file uploads using your GraphQL server.

Don't do it. If you are going to do it:

- It adds huge network load on your server,
- It'll cost you more money,
- You won't be able to upload files using SwiftGraphQL.

This guide explains how to do it better.

## Server

Instead of consuming all the traffic of file uploads on your server and streaming it to AWS S3, you are going to use signed upload URLs. This way, your client is going to upload files directly to AWS S3 and your server is going to reference them.

- the server is going to be responsible for creating signed URLs, and
- the client is going to be responsible for handling uploads

```typescript

```

## Client

Instead of passing in your file as a GraphQL mutation parameter, you are going to request a file from your GraphQL server and then use native Swift methods to upload your file there. In short, the flow is going to consist of

1. Requesting the `upload_url` and `file_id`,
1. Uploading the file to `upload_url`,
1. Using the `file_id` in mutation to link your file to a database model.

```swift

```
